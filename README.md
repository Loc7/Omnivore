# Omnivore
## Machine Translation preprocessor

This little tool helps you prepare source texts for machine translation.

<p>Tutorial:</p>
						<p>Often times a client sends you text that is filled with HTML-tags, text-keys or is a
							JSON-file. Pasting it directly into a machine translation program produces a mess. This tool
							helps you with placeholders and remembers them until the translated text gets copied back
							into the textarea.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Set desired mode</li>
							<li>Copy source text into textarea</li>
							<li>[Omnivore replaces elements with placeholders]</li>
							<li>Copy changed text into machine translation program</li>
							<li>[MT program translates the text and leaves placeholders unchanged]</li>
							<li>Copy translation back into textarea</li>
							<li>[Omnivore replaces placeholders with original elements]</li>
							<li>Copy changed text into target</li>
						</ul>
